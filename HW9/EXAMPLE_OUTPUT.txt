FINAL JUDGE OUTPUT
================================================================================
{
  "final_verdict": "Deepfake",
  "summary": "The council has reached a unanimous decision that the analyzed video is a Deepfake. Gemini 3 Pro identified distinct temporal anomalies and lip-sync issues (approx. 200ms delay). GPT-5.2 detected spatial inconsistencies in lighting shadows across frames 4-7. Qwen 3 VL confirmed pixel-level blending artifacts around the jawline. The high average confidence (0.93) supports a definitive Deepfake classification.",
