Fill out a web-based version of BOIR and submit online.\n\nBoth methods require the filing to be done online, as BOIRs cannot be mailed or faxed to FinCEN. The person submitting a BOIR will need to provide their name and email address to FinCEN, and will receive confirmation of submission when the BOIR is accepted by FinCEN.",

The specific information required is described in these instructions and Chapter 4 of FinCEN's Small Entity Compliance Guide.\n6.
