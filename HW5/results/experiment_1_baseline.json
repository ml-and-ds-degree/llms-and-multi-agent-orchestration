Use of \"Parent/Guardian\" vs. \"minor child\": If one of your beneficial owners is a minor child, you can report their parent or legal guardian's information instead using Item 35.\n3. Use of FinCEN Identifier: You can provide a FinCEN Identifier for a beneficial owner instead of reporting the owner's personal information (Items 36-51).",
