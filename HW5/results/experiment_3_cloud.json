To identify beneficial owners, review Chapter 2 of FinCEN's Small Entity Compliance Guide.\n7. If your reporting company has a principal place of business in the United States or U.S. Territory, the street address should be that of the principal place of business.\n\nThese points highlight the key requirements and procedures for submitting beneficial ownership information to FinCEN as a business owner.",
