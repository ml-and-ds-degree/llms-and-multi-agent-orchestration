The Corporate Transparency Act requires certain types of U.S. and foreign entities to report beneficial ownership information to FinCEN.\n2. Beneficial ownership information is about the entity, its beneficial owners, and in certain cases, its company applicants.\n3. You must report this information through Beneficial Ownership Information Reports (BOIRs) to FinCEN.\n4. You can report a FinCEN Identifier for a beneficial owner instead of providing personal information.\n5. You can add or remove beneficial owners using the \"+\" or \"-\" keys at the top of Part III.\n\nIt's also recommended that you review FinCEN's Small Entity Compliance Guide, which includes interactive flowcharts, checklists, and other resources to help determine if an entity needs to file a BOIR with FinCEN and how to comply with the reporting requirements.",
